# MDD
The domain we chose is a front-end game language based on HTML and JavaScript.
Most projects in this domain require the development of multiple JavaScript files and css files to ensure the normal operation of the front-end system. 
In the process of development and later optimization, it may not be very easy to modify the project. 
In response to this problem, we hope to develop a language that can simply change some of the core content in JavaScript to facilitate development and maintenance.
